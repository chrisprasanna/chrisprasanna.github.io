									<h2>Cerebral Palsy Rehabilitation Product Design & Fabrication</h2>
									<p>Undergraduate Capstone Project</p>
								</header>
								<section>

										<h3>Project Goal</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The primary goal of this project was to create an underwater stationary cycle 
										that allows clients with cerebral palsy to exercise in a pool 
										environment. Another requirement for the device was discrete and adjustable 
										resistance levels for the pedaling system.
									</p>
								</section>
								<header>
									<h3>Challenges</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Comfort was one of the most important customer requirements and it was imperative 
									that this criterion was specifically defined for the design. Stability and overall 
									safety of the device were also essential criteria when considering the design 
									options. Additionally, proper material selection was key in order to avoid 
									corrosion or embrittlement issues which could lead to buckling and device failure. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Ease of manufacturing was another key concern, as excessive complexity and tolerances 
									on machined parts could have set the project back significantly. Ease of operation and the 
									weight of the device also needed to be optimized when designing the product.
									One specific challenge was that the purchased stainless steel square rods used to 
									adjust the device height did not come in sizes that allowed them to slide within 
									each other with minimal clearance. 
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>My Solution</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									In order to endure a chlorinated water environment, which is highly corrosive, 316L 
									stainless steel and Delrin were chosen as the primary materials. Additionally, a 
									sacrificial zinc anode was attached to the rear support of the cycle. 3D-printed sleeves 
									were fabricated as well in order to better secure the adjustable stainless 
									steel rods. Also, the resistance could be easily increased by extending a custom insert from 
									the pedals.
								</p>
								<p>
									Minimal required support was included in the final design which reduced the device’s weight without 
									sacrificing user safety. Velcro belts with emergency releases and padding were also added 
									to the device for user safety and comfort. Finally, design verification tests were conducted 
									to ensure that all the client’s requirements were met. 
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Notable Features & Accomplishments</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Implemented QFD, DFMA, and DFMEA protocols to quantify client needs, reduce production 
											time, minimize costs, and identify potential system failures. </li>
										<li>Designed all parts and assembles in SOLIDWORKS. In addition, design drawings were 
											constructed using GD&T standards. </li>
										<li>All device parts could be easily assembled and disassembled within 6 minutes.</li>
										<li>The product was portable and weighed about 60 pounds.  </li>
									</ul>
								</p>
